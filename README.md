A bit about me:

- 🎓I'm doing a Bachelor's in Science of Applied Technology at BYUI.
- 📚 I spend most of my time learning and teaching.
- 🗣  I speak three languages and still want to learn a few more.
- 🎨 I love drawing and design.
- 🧠 I enjoy logic challenges and riddles.
- Fun fact: I invented my own recipe to prepare pizza from scratch, and pretend I speak Italian every time I make one.🍕
